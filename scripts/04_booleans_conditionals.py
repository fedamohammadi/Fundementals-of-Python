04_booleans_conditionals.py

Purpose:
--------
Learn boolean logic and conditional statements.
This is essential for research work because you constantly make decisions like:
- filter rows
- handle missing values
- apply rules based on thresholds
- build indicators (0/1 variables)

Concepts covered (progressively):
- bool type and comparisons
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- if / elif / else
- Common patterns: threshold rules, missing checks, category mapping
