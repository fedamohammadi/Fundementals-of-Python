# 📊 Fundamentals of Python  
### Python for Data Analysis, Econometrics, and Research

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a structured, research-focused Python learning path.

It starts from core Python fundamentals and moves quickly into applied data analysis and econometrics. The goal is not just to learn syntax. The goal is to build the skills required to:

- Clean real datasets  
- Run regression models  
- Perform causal inference  
- Work with panel and time series data  
- Produce reproducible research  

This repo is built for students and researchers in economics, data science, and social sciences who want Python to be a serious research tool.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repository focuses on:

- Writing clean and readable code  
- Understanding complete data workflows  
- Reproducibility  
- Econometric reasoning  
- Applied modeling  

Each script is self-contained and runnable.  
Each dataset is stored locally for reproducibility.  
Each concept builds toward applied research skills.

## 📂 Data

Datasets are exported locally using `get_data.py`.

Sources include:

- Wooldridge econometrics datasets (via statsmodels)
- Built-in statsmodels datasets
- Small structured examples for reproducible modeling

To regenerate the datasets:

python get_data.py


## 📈 What You Will Learn

This repository is structured to move from core programming skills to applied econometrics and research workflows.

---

### 🧩 Core Python Foundations

You will build a solid programming base, including:

- Variables and data types  
- Functions and scope  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples  
- Error handling and debugging  
- File input/output  
- Basic project organization  

The goal is to write clean, readable, and logical code.

---

### 📊 Data Analysis with Python

You will learn how to work with real datasets using modern data tools:

- NumPy arrays and vectorization  
- Pandas Series and DataFrames  
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Merging and reshaping datasets  
- Groupby operations and aggregation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn  

The focus is on practical workflows used in research and applied economics.

---

### 📉 Econometrics in Practice

You will implement econometric models using real datasets:

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression  
- Interpreting coefficients and log transformations  
- Model diagnostics and residual analysis  
- Robust and clustered standard errors  
- Panel data and fixed effects  
- Difference-in-Differences  
- Instrumental Variables (2SLS)  
- Introduction to time series modeling  

The emphasis is on connecting theory to code.
